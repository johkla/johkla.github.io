ah yes. a new about page.  
my name is johannes klabbers and i am ...  
*what am i actually ...?*  
what do people who click on the `about` link on a webpage want to find out?

is there a quick way of making a duplicate of a file in nvUltra or do i have to go to the finder to do that?!

these are some questions you may have.

**what do i do?**
i talk to people about life and death and what it means to be a human being â€” and i write about those subjects.

i am a provisional clinical pastoral care supervisor in the spiritual care department at peter maccallum in melbourne, australia. i divide my time between australia and europe.  

**what are my qualifications?**
you might say i am a therapist and a spiritual carer so my most relevant qualifications are in spiritual care and narrative therapy. i also have a phd in visual arts.

**what have i done?**
i wrote a book called i am here.  
i am an ex-artist and a recovering academic.  
i used to play guitar in a punk band.  

**i want to talk with you. how do i arrange this and how much does it cost?**
i talk to people as what is called in dutch medemens.

----------------------

<small>and after that the questions get a bit more complicated i imagine... if there's anything that you'd like to know which is not covered here or on the linked pages? feel free to send me an email or contact me, anonymously if you like, via this form.</small>

here are some more questions you might ask. i am working on answering them right here

**you say you're not religious but you do spiritual care. what is spiritual about it?**

well.  
i am not fond of the word spiritual, since for a lot of people that equates to 'woo woo'. i am deeply interested in what we could call the mystery.
