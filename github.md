so i moved my blog again but as always, the URL [now.johannesk.com](now.johannesk.com) will get you to the new **now** page, and [blog.johannesk.com](http://blog.johannesk.com) to the blog but you will get sent back to blot at some point.  

this version is running on [github](github) pages powered by [jekyll](jekyll) with the minima theme. it has been a rocky road but i think i am beginning to like it ðŸ™‚ as much as one _can_ like frigging around with code and backends. 

for now most of the old stuff is still on [blot](http://johannesk.blot.im) though since the other bits will take (a lot) longer to move across.



i am moving my website (again) from [blot](blot) to [github](github) pages running on [jekyll](jekyll) â€” this is not long after deciding to move my website to s3 but writing in markdown then generating an html page and putting it on s3 is just too much of a hassle. blogging has to be FUN! 

jekyll is not as much fun as blot but it does automatically generate the html pages ... anyway i won't go on about it now. you can read my rants about servers and websites at the links.

the long and the short of it is : there will be weirdness, URLs will change and the move will take time.
