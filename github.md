This is the github page. It uses the page layout.

It is here because I am moving my website to github.

It's also a place to collect some things I need to remember about github. Mostly these are horrible hacks, since, really, I have no idea what I'm doing :p

This page will probably disappear from the menu at some point so bookmark the url if you want to come back to it.

If you want a page not to appear in the menu, set the title in the front matter of the page to ``&nbsp;``. Simply leaving the title blank does not work!
