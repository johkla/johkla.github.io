One of the benefits of converting to Islam, which admittedly I am quite unlikely to do, would be that it'd really piss off the Patriarch who reserves a special kind of hatred for Muslims, similar but not quite as intense as his dislike of Chinese people and socialists.

The other benefit would be that you'd get to adopt an Islamic name. Am I correct in thinking that one of [the ninety nine names of Allah](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names%5C_of%5C_God%5C_in%5C_Islam) is a common choice? And I would insist on only being addressed by my Islamic name.

Would you choose the name for the meaning or for the word itself?

If I was to go for meaning, the name I would choose would be Al Fattaa الفتاح The Opener — or Al Mujeeb المجيب The Responsive; The Answerer.

If I was to go for a word, I would choose العزيز Azziz [link](https://wahiduddin.net/words/99_pages/aziz_8.htm)— also spelled Azeez but to have the letter z in one's name three times would be awesome. I love the letter z for its shape, but also because it is the last letter, and it seems quite underused. Also you can add z to be the beginning of any file name and when you reverse sort the list of files by name it puts it first in the list.

# not now

increasingly i find my-so-called-self saying "thirty years ago i ..." i suppose that's a Thing about being 60 — that's half a lifetime ago and there you were in the world doing things, like putting speed up your nose — i think that was before i started putting it in my arm. 

the problem with saying 'thirty years ago this or that' is that it's not very interesting to the people who have only been walking around on the planet for the last thirty years. and who can blame them? if someone tried to talk to me about thirty years ago when i was thirty i would have tried to get away from them as soon as humanly possible. what an old bore!

meanwhile a long, long way away there was a thing taking pictures of us.
 *K., look baby that's us!* 
not that there is much to see but it does make me wonder how much things have actually changed since copernicus. thirty years later humanity is, more than ever, locked into the mirror phase and likely to remain there for the foreseeable future.

carl sagan, a sort of more contemporary version of copernicus i guess, said, "we are just a pale blue dot." there are, probably quite literally, a billion much more beautiful and more interesting images made by space 'probes' and telescopes but this one, not just depicting “a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark”, but *us* baby, became one of the most famous.
