title: now
---

i know i am late to the fantastiCAL (geddit?) party but i am here now and it _is_ fantastic.* 

unfortunately because the new version is only available by subscription and i am not in the position financially to subscribe. so but and there is itsycal. it is free. but  yes i am willing to PAY for the previous version. i don't need to embed ZOOM meetings in my calendar nor any of the other bells and whistles. i am not a power user. i am not interested in power. but beware of the message that says you can upgrade to 3 and keep all the features from 2... it looks to me as if there are a number of crucial features which ARE available in 2 which are NOT available in the 3 upgrade without paying.

<small>* being able to access and create reminders and appointments from the menubar AND edit them? fantastical!</small>
