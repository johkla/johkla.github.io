Ja sorry hoor maar je 'past niet meer in de formule', zei ik tegen [In The Pines van The Triffids](https://www.discogs.com/Triffids-In-The-Pines/release/904387) in the CD sale at the Utrecht City Library on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Ach ... 1986 ... you were recorded on an 8 track in a shearing shed in Western Australia, 600kms to Perth in four days beginning on my grandmother's birthday. You can stream it on Spotify probably but without the sleeve how would you know that Robert McComb Hit a Large Water Tank With Broom on 'Just Might Fade Away' and that the budget was a bit over a thousand dollars Australian, the most expensive item being beer, wine and vodka and that all the sheep came from Woodstock?
