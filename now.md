One of the benefits of converting to Islam, which admittedly I am quite unlikely to do, would be that it'd really piss off the Patriarch who reserves a special kind of hatred for Muslims, similar but not quite as intense as his dislike of Chinese people and socialists.

The other benefit would be that you'd get to adopt an Islamic name. Am I correct in thinking that one of [the ninety nine names of Allah](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names%5C_of%5C_God%5C_in%5C_Islam) is a common choice? And I would insist on only being addressed by my Islamic name.

Would you choose the name for the meaning or for the word itself?

If I was to go for meaning, the name I would choose would be Al Fattaa الفتاح The Opener — or Al Mujeeb المجيب The Responsive; The Answerer.

If I was to go for a word, I would choose العزيز Azziz [link](https://wahiduddin.net/words/99_pages/aziz_8.htm)— also spelled Azeez but to have the letter z in one's name three times would be awesome. I love the letter z for its shape, but also because it is the last letter, and it seems quite underused. Also you can add z to be the beginning of any file name and when you reverse sort the list of files by name it puts it first in the list.
