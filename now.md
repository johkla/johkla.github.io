ok so [mubi](https://mubi.com/showing) is now available in the netherlands.

as you'll recall, it's a kind of anti-netflix : thirty arthouse movies, each day a new movie is added and another one disappears.

let the ~~pandemic~~ ... thirty day free trial begin.

today i am watching the last film francois truffaut made, *vivement dimanche!* (so *finally, sunday!* but for reasons best known to some marketing department somewhere, it was released as *confidentially yours* in english-speaking countries) with fanny ardent from 1983. truffaut died the next year, aged 52, after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
