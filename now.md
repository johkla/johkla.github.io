# not now

increasingly i find my-so-called-self saying "thirty years ago i ..." i suppose that's the thing about being 60 — that's half a lifetime ago and there you were in the world doing things, like putting speed up your nose — i think this is before i started putting it in my arm. 

the problem with saying 'thirty years ago this or that' is that it's not very interesting to the people who have only been walking around on the planet for thirty years. and who can blame them? if someone tried to talk to me about thirty years ago when i was thirty i would have tried to get away from them as soon as humanly possible. what an old bore!

meanwhile a long, long way away there was a thing taking pictures of us : *look baby that's us!** not that there is much to see but it does make me wonder how much things have actually changed since copernicus. as far as humanity is concerned it is still very much in the mirror phase and likely to remain there for the foreseeable future.

carl sagan, a sort of more contemporary version of copernicus i guess, said, "we are just a pale blue dot." the image, depicting “a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark”, became one of the most famous in space exploration.
