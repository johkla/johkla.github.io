**love goes to a building on fire**

when my love  
stands next to your love  
i can't compare love  
when it's not love

it's not love   
it's not love  
which is my face   
which is a building  
which is on fire   
on fire  

when my love  
stands next to your love  
i can't define love  
when it's not love

it's not love  
it's not love  
which is my face  
which is a building   
which is on fire

i've got two loves  
i've got two loves  
and they go tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, like little birds  
they're my two loves...  
and they go tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, like little birds  
they're my two loves...  
count them one, two loves ...  
count them one, two loves ...

which is my face  
which is a building  
which is on fire  
on fire  

when my love  
stands next to your love  
i can't define love  
when it's not love

it's not love  
it's not love  
which is my face  
which is a building  
which is on fire
