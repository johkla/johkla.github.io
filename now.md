title: now
---

i am moving my website (again) from [blot](blot) to [github](github) pages running on [jekyll](jekyll) — this is not long after deciding to move my website to s3 but writing in markdown then generating an html page and putting it on s3 is just too much of a hassle. blogging has to be FUN! 

jekyll is not as much fun as blot but it does automatically generate the html pages ... anyway i won't go on about it now. you can read my rants about servers and websites at the links.

the long and the short of it is : there will be weirdness, URLs will change and the move will take time. 

so this is the new **now** page.   
as always, the URL [now.johannesk.com](now.johannesk.com) will get you there.  

the other bits will take (a lot) longer to move across. 

**not now**
