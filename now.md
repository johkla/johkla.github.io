title: now
---

Having been eaten up and spat out by the postmodernist/poststructuralist rollercoaster in the eighties and nineties, I am a reconstructed, as opposed to an unreconstructed, Romantic. What stayed with me somehow over all those years, is the capacity for a different relation to the impossible — a kind of magical thinking; even if for a long time I had to keep it hidden in a little pocket in a folded up part of my-so-called-self and I didn't have words for it until I did a PhD. When the new millennium came I was halfway through it and in a way I freed my-so-called-self from the the previous millennium. In 2002 I put everything I had into that gallery space, my books, my wires, my computers, one hundred thousand words. Everything was connected to everything else, except the neons that changed from TRUTH to BEAUTY and back again. And then I was to all intents and purposes, finished with Art. And it was finished with me, although it would take the best part of a decade to be free of the Academy, such as it was, in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales.

And now?  
I am here, i as other.  
(Sorry. Re-reading Rimbaud...)

<small>*I is another. If the brass wakes the trumpet, it’s not its fault. That’s obvious to me: I witness the unfolding of my own thought: I watch it, I hear it: I make a stroke with the bow: the symphony begins in the depths, or springs with a bound onto the stage.*</small>

<small>*If the old imbeciles hadn’t discovered only the false significance of Self, we wouldn’t have to now sweep away those millions of skeletons which have been piling up the products of their one-eyed intellect since time immemorial, and claiming themselves to be their authors!*</small>

<small>Rimbaud in a Letter to Paul Demeny 15 May 1871. </small>

**Heart Amulet**  
Egypt  
ca. 1295–1070 B.C.  

> For the ancient Egyptians, the heart (ib) was the source of intelligence, feelings, and actions. A person's memory was also housed in the heart and so at the judgment ceremony (Weighing of the Heart) in the afterlife, the heart was able to speak on behalf of the deceased, accounting to Osiris for a lifetime of deeds. Therefore, heart amulets were only used on the mummy to protect the owner's organ and to ensure that his heart gave a positive response at judgment.
