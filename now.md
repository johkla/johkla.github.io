title: now
---

three movies, each bad in their own way and for different reasons. one, about francis bacon, with derek jacobi, i abandoned because the director was trying too hard to imitate the painter's style — or *something* — and i couldn't bear it. the other two i watched until the bitter end, and bitter was the end of *magic mountains* in which hannah hoekstra climbs a mountain in the tatras, really, for no good reason. but hands up those who know where the tartra mountains are. exactly. who knew there was a spectacular mountain range on the border between poland and slovakia?

hannah hoekstra reminds me more than a little of a one time muse in newcastle, new south wales, 1993. of all the women i've loved perhaps that love was the most unrequited. i'd say hannah hoekstra would the only reason i can think of for watching the film and she might not be enough. it would love to see her in a really good film, with someone really good opposite her instead of the dead grub in this one, directed by, say greta gerwig, but it seems good films can't made in the netherlands. 

as for the other, a dreadful hotchpotch (even including horrible, gratuitous footage of civilian victims of war for no apparent reason) called 'bird on a wire', about leonard cohen. thankfully not the boring old hallelujah-i'm-a-zen-monk-now leonard but the earlier one who suddenly found fame and fortune in his 30s when, after a spectacularly unsuccessful career as a writer, he reinvented himself as a folksinger of sorts. 

the film was made and then lost for 40 years until it was recently pieced together from 3,000 found fragments. it can't make up its mind whether to focus on the performances, such as they are, or the shenanigans backstage and on the way to and from the gigs. the problem is : i just don't *get* leonard cohen, never did, never will. ok i get that he has/had a marketable presence, and a disarming smile but his music is just not very interesting is it? 

"*suzanne* comes from three different concerts,” the director proudly proclaims. “they were done in different tempos, different keys and even different lyrics. but with the wonders of today’s digital technology, we made it look like one performance.”

so leonard takes a bath, leonard begins to sing a song and then stops and complains about the audience clapping. the final concert was in jerusalem of all places and leonard leaves the stage halfway through the gig because he's not feeling it. backstage leonard has a shave and drops a tab of acid then walks back out but you'd have no idea what exactly happened next except for leonard's tears, which flow freely.

well that, at least, is something.

Heart Amulet  
Egypt  
ca. 1295–1070 B.C.  

For the ancient Egyptians, the heart (ib) was the source of intelligence, feelings, and actions. A person's memory was also housed in the heart and so at the judgment ceremony (Weighing of the Heart) in the afterlife, the heart was able to speak on behalf of the deceased, accounting to Osiris for a lifetime of deeds. Therefore, heart amulets were only used on the mummy to protect the owner's organ and to ensure that his heart gave a positive response at judgment.
