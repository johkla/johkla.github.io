this country is all about holding back the rivers and the sea. going with the flow is not an option here. hundreds of machines work day and night to pump the water out. it is rather like living in a leaky boat.

# not now :

*notes from the Time Before*

monday 9  
tasmania 

i am leaving again

i just got here and before that i left after i'd just arrived somewhere else and before that ... no wait ... i'd been where i was too long and i was keen to get out. 

but now i want to return : to my love for you, to think about it and to feel it. 

there was one significant revelation this morning : to acknowledge that you love someone, in whichever way you can, is significant. why? because the mutuality of it, the reciprocation, is its life blood ...

omg there is a drop of blood emoji?!

being and love are not separate.  
do you believe me? 

the significance of blood : i bleed for you.
 
if i bleed for you, you will believe in me, yes? 
also : if i bleed for myself, i will believe in myself.
