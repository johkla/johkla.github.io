title: now

my heart is good. she may have even used the word beautiful, the thin, anxious looking cardiologist with the double barrel name who was trying not to look anxious. 

i wondered briefly if computer screens enable people to be doctors who were not able to be doctors before computers because they can't bear to look someone fair and square in the eye and speak with them. a contemporary doctor doesn't need to look you in the eye. you look at them, and they look at their computer screen and type on the keyboard. one day i am going to get out my laptop in a doctors surgery and type on it as i am speaking with them about my body and how shit it feels. 

she didn't raise an eyebrow when i mentioned smoking one or two cigarettes a day, which is actually more of a half—truth since i usually smoke three or four.

my heart does not look broken. it is pumping a good amount of blood around my body and the valves are good, opening and closing as they should and there is no evidence of any calcium deposits or anything untoward. but, she said, looking for the first time at me instead of her computer, i can't see inside your heart... 
— quite. because if you could, what you would see is something you don't want to see.

yesterday i renamed my computer 'uncomputer' after reading alexander galloway's wonderful essay. it will probably create some problems but i don't care.

# not now

increasingly i find my-so-called-self saying "thirty years ago i ..." i suppose that's a Thing about being 60 — that's half a lifetime ago and there you were in the world doing things, like putting speed up your nose — i think that was before i started putting it in my arm. 

the problem with saying 'thirty years ago this or that' is that it's not very interesting to the people who have only been walking around on the planet for the last thirty years. and who can blame them? if someone tried to talk to me about thirty years ago when i was thirty i would have tried to get away from them as soon as humanly possible. what an old bore!

meanwhile a long, long way away there was a thing taking pictures of us : *K., look baby that's us!** not that there is much to see but it does make me wonder how much things have actually changed since copernicus. thirty years later humanity is, more than ever, locked into the mirror phase and likely to remain there for the foreseeable future.

carl sagan, a sort of more contemporary version of copernicus i guess, said, "we are just a pale blue dot." there are, probably quite literally, a billion much more beautiful and more interesting images made by space 'probes' and telescopes but this one, not just depicting “a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark”, but *us* baby, became one of the most famous.
