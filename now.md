i'm thinking of signing up with [pcloud](https://www.pcloud.com/cloud-storage-pricing-plans.html). i like dropbox and i've been using it happily for years but they recently introduced a limit of 3 devices on the free version which is not ideal for someone with four active devices. i would give them some money but not €10 a month *paid a year in advance*. also i don't need 2TB. you can have 50GB on icloud for AUD1.49 billed monthly but pcloud gives you  500GB for €5 a month and the interface, whilst obviously not as deeply integrated into ios and mac os, is good! there is the *option* of paying a year in advance and receiving 20% discount = €47.88 which makes it €4 a month.

pcloud also have a life plan. but i am a bit weary of 'life' plans. who's life are we talking about? theirs or mine? i don't have long to live but what they mean by life is 99 years. so provided they don't go bust and there is no apocalypse, 500GB of my stuff would be up there for 99 years which i kind of like. there is a rudimentary public_html folder function (although not on the free plan which nevertheless is worth getting and if you use [this link](https://my.pcloud.com/#page=register&invite=ITQ07ZSTeDck) to sign up we both get an extra 1GB) but since they don't offer any kind of domain forwarding, the public_html folder is not that much use.

what to do...?

![de beauvoir, 1955.](http://johannesk.com.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/img/beauvoir55.jpeg)

an unusual picture of simone de beauvoir taken in 1955. most photographers show her as quite severe but here, you are 3 and she is your favourite aunt who is going to read to you.  
which story would you like?  
— *une mort très douce*, please auntie!
