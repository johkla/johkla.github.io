some days, like today, when i really don't feel up to or for anything, i love it when someone cancels an appointment. 

also i don't really mind when i have a telephone appointment with someone and they don't call me. i don't encourage it but it's really ok since i don't really love  telephone conversations, my preference being for either face to face meetings or asynchronous communications.

<small>what i don't love is when i have an appointment with someone in a particular place that i have to travel to and they don't show up. if you are out there reading this, i still haven't forgiven you.</small>

# not now

in the past, when i had an office, i learned to always set up appointments with people for times when i would be in the office anyway. and if i had a lot of work to do i would be secretly hoping for a no show so i could get on with it. and if a person was more than ten minutes late for an appointment i would sometimes close the door and lock it and not respond to knocking.
