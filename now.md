*response to questions about radical optimism from becoming posthumanists :*

i think perhaps i became a radical optimist because i *was* disappointed.  
disappointed with life, in love, in what is possible for a human being. 

i found solace in the radical decision to be optimistic, as an intention, an attitude, a practice â€” rather than to allow oneself to be pushed and pulled around by hope, which seems to come and go and to find that being optimistic is possible. it is an act of agency, of autonomy, in spite of everything. 

to refuse to succumb to pessimism and nihilism, to cynicism and the emptiness of irony and sarcasm is a political and ethical decision.

everything is possible, even the impossible.  
a posthumanist can only be optimistic, radically.
