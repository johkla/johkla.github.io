<small>the big potato, robertson nsw, australia.</small>

some days, like today, when i really don't feel up to or for anything, i love it when someone cancels an appointment. 

also i don't really mind when i have a telephone appointment with someone and they don't call me. i don't encourage it but it's ok since i don't really love  telephone conversations, my preference being for either face to face meetings or asynchronous communications.

<small>what i don't love is when i have an appointment with someone in a particular place that i have to travel to and they don't show up. and what i really hate is travelling to the other side of the world to participate in a festival and when i get there finding that nothing whatsoever has been done to make it possible for me to do anything (but that is whole story in itself for another time). if you are out there reading this, i still haven't forgiven you.</small>

# not now

in the past, when i had an office, i learned to always set up appointments with people for times when i would be in the office anyway. and if i had a lot of work to do i would be secretly hoping for a no show so i could get on with it. and if a person was more than ten minutes late for an appointment i would sometimes close the door and lock it and not respond to knocking.
