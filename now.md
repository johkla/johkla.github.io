in russian there are two different words for truth — i let a talking head on tv tell me this.* one of them, Правда (pravda), is apparently a 'more aspirational truth' and therefore can be utilised for purposes that are not in fact related to how things actually are.

and english?

i am not in favour of the misuse of the prefix post— which in the case of 'post-truth' seems to have lead to the idea that truth has become irrelevant and thus straight-faced lying, and just saying that you didn't do what you obviously did do or that what happened did not, is perfectly acceptable, especially if you're a politician or a news organisation which is owned by, and whose function is to represent the facts in a way which suits, the powers that be and the rich.  

but there is 'sooth' as in 'soothsayer' — now archaic but maybe it could be revived. is that the truth, we used to say, or did you read it in the daily mail? (a notorious right wing uk newspaper.) i still say it with some regularity when the old man i live with expounds, at excruciating length, some absurd conspiracy theory and/or a horrendous wilful misreading of historical events. (am i using wilful appropriately there? wilful and deliberate are not the same thing! i think i learned this from sarah ahmed and i am not just saying that to parade my woke credentials)

'sooth' could be an appropriate word for a kind of soothing truth, like saying 'it's ok' when it's not actually, but the intention is to try and make it so, to console or to make someone feel better — and a soothsayer : one who by speaking, soothes, who speaks sooth, a different kind of aspirational truth perhaps?

<small>*this is a straight translation of something dutch speakers say which i rather like in the context of so called post-truth : 'ik heb me laten vertellen dat...' it means that you 'allowed' someone tell to you something. it is a kind of humble pre-amble to something else you're about to say that you don't necessarily endorse yourself and/or that you cannot vouch for its veracity.</small>

# not now

*notes from the Time Before*

monday 9  
tasmania 

i am leaving again...?

i just got here and before that i left after i'd just arrived somewhere else and before that i ... no wait ... i'd been where i was too long and i was keen to get out. 

but now i want to return : to my love for you, to think about it and to feel it. 

there was one significant revelation this morning : to acknowledge that you love someone who loves you, in whichever way you can, is significant. why? because the mutuality of it, the reciprocation, is its life blood ...

omg there is a drop of blood emoji?!

being and love are not separate.  
*do you believe me?* 

the significance of blood : i bleed for you.
 
if i bleed for you, you will believe in me, yes?   
and also : if i bleed for myself, i will believe in myself.  

maybe i've got a messiah complex.
