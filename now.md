ok so [mubi](https://mubi.com/showing) is now available in the netherlands.

as you'll recall, mubi is a kind of anti-netflix : thirty arthouse movies, each day a new movie is added and another one disappears.

let the ~~pandemic~~ ... thirty day free trial begin.

today i am watching the last film francois truffaut made, [*vivement dimanche!*](https://mubi.com/films/confidentially-yours/ratings/19480951) (so *finally, sunday!* but for reasons best known to some marketing department somewhere, it was released as *confidentially yours* in english-speaking countries) with fanny ardent from 1983. truffaut died the next year, aged 52, after being diagnosed with a brain tumor. 

it seems fitting to begin with the last film made by a committed cinephile, for whom every moment that he wasn't watching or making a film â€” or writing (and one assumes thinking about) about film was a distraction.

</p>meanwhile the one and only [review of my book on amazon]() is not exactly complimentary. i particularly enjoyed the bit where he says <span style="background-color: yellow">*his frequent mention of the ten to the power of 500 universes and eleven dimensions makes you want to scream.*</span> i love the idea of people wanting to scream when they read what i've written. 



and also : i can hear keith laughing his head off somewhere beyond the grave. it made him want to scream too.
