# about time
{:.no_toc}

ah yes. a new about page. about time. 

my name is johannes klabbers and i am ...  
*but what am i actually ...?*  

i am not a fan of writing in the third person as if this is not me writing about my-so-called-self and i am deeply ambivalent about writing in the first person, although it does have its uses — but not on an  `about`  page : "i do this and that and before that i did this... and this is why i am really great..." ha ha. please!

but what do people who click on the `about` link on a webpage want to find out? let's see...  

you might have questions and you could just ask them but are some answers that you, if you knew me and my work, might give.

where are you from? what did you do before you did this? what are you going to do?

## who or what i am?

ok so easy questions first ... not. let's leave this question for another time but i've said what my name is. i was born in the netherlands in utrecht in the same year as george harrison joined the quarrymen, richard alpert met timothy leary and hanna arendt published the human condition.[^1]

### now 

#### what do you do?

you might say that i talk to people about life and death and what it means to be a human being — and i write about those subjects.

you might say i am sometimes a writer, and/or sometimes a therapist or and/or sometimes a spiritual carer in private practice and/or sometimes a (provisional) clinical pastoral care supervisor — albeit non-religious or post-religious — in the spiritual care department at peter maccallum cancer centre in melbourne, australia. i divide my time between europe and australia. 

you might say i am sometimes a *levenseindebegeleider*, a long dutch word which has no direct english equivalent but it refers to someone who talks with people who are at or close to the end of their lives.  

##### what are your qualifications?

the most relevant tertiary qualifications are in spiritual care and narrative therapy. there is also a phd in visual arts, as well as undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications in visual arts and education. all but one of these qualifications are from australian universities and the formal training in clinical pastoral care also took place in australia. the masters in theology and religious studies spiritual care is from the vrije universiteit in amsterdam.

*it's not so easy writing without using any personal pronouns! does it seem weirdly artificial? or is it ok?*

#### let's talk about money

**i want to talk with you. how do i arrange this and how much does it cost?**

we can talk on skypewhatsappfacetime for nothing although i prefer at least one face to face meeting to begin with, in which case i ask for a contribution to my travel costs.

anyone can make a donation at anytime but i don't charge fees.  

please use the contact form to set up an appointment.

#### historical

**what have i done?**
i wrote a book called i am here.  
i am an ex-artist and a recovering academic.  
i used to play guitar in a punk band more than forty years ago.

<small>after that the questions get a bit more complicated i imagine... if there's anything that you'd like to know which is not covered here or on the linked pages? feel free to send me an email or contact me, anonymously if you like, via this form.</small>

here are some more questions you might ask. i am working on answering them right here.

what i am not

**you say you're not religious but you do spiritual care. what is spiritual about it?**

well.  
i am not fond of the word spiritual, since for a lot of people that equates to 'woo woo'. i am deeply interested in what we could call the mystery.
