really, apart from moving house, moving your website is the worst moving job in the world. and google doesn't like it. not that i care about what google likes or doesn't like it is more a question of google produces a link to one of my pages that doesn't work anymore. and that is kind of sad. right? eventually google will work out that the link doesn't work anymore and there will be a black mark against my name in the big book of google because i moved my website.

for years i published a blog on a platform called blot.  
it is still [there](http://johannesk.blot.im) but is no longer updated.

what you are looking at now is a website generated by [jekyll](jekyll) running on [github](github).


----------------------

take for example this URL, which google likes :
[johannesk.com/2019/march](http://johannesk.com/2019/march) no idea why google likes it but it has some good stuff in there. some interesting, useful stuff. you can read it [here](http://blog.johannesk.com/2019/march).

it dates from a time when i foolishly entrusted blot with my root domain which is now hosted on amazon s3 since, unlike blot, it doesn't go down very often, if at all. but when you click on the link in google it produced an error



----------------------

so why are you no longer using blot?! don't you love blot?
— yes. i do. i love blot. it's a heroic project and david does an enormous amount of work to make it all happen. i have been a user and a subscriber for many years (i am even thanked on blot's about page).

the beauty of blot (when it is working) is that when you save a page of text to a particular dropbox folder, it instantly shows up on your website. change something on the page and it instantly updates on your website. it's simple and its clean. and when it works, it works brilliantly. i started making websites in 1995 and since using blot i've never been happier. 

it is all plain text and the files just live in your dropbox. unfortunately dropbox ain't what it used to be since you can only run it on 3 machines now. but still. it's free and i like free because i have very little money. although i only pay USD20 a year being an early adopter, i think USD 3 per months is worth every cent.

except that ...

but there is the problem is the downtime. even now as i write this (27-1-20 1:26 pm CET) blot is not accessible. when you go to my now page you get :

> 502 Bad Gateway  
> openresty 

i don't even get a notice from uptime robot saying that the site is down because the server does respond, it just responds with an error!

there have been many, many hours of downtime in recent months and david assures me he is working on a fix but for me there is nothing worse than spending time and energy writing something and publishing it and for it then not to be accessible. this is not a business decision, i don't run a business. i don't even care if no one reads what i write but i want it to be _possible_ for what i write to be read.

the problem with a server bring maintained by one guy is that if the server goes down when that guy is asleep or on holidays or away for the weekend or when the guy cann't work out what the problem is or how to fix it... well then you don't have a website.	

----------------------


so if you don't use blot, what are you going you use?
- ... like most things, it depends what you need, what you want and what you don't want.

1. i don't want what i write to be locked into a proprietary online database i want everything on my website to be on my own hard drive as well.

2. i don't want to write html or css. plain text/markdown is all i want to use.

3. i want it to be cheap, free if possible.

4. i don't want to have to deal with a whole bunch of bullshit when i want to publish something i've written.

5. i don't want ads on or anywhere near my site

6. i want it to look really clean, simple and straightforward — and load fast.

7. i want better than 99% up time.

Cloud Cannon - is not really an alternative to blot. it might be interesting though...

Droppages is free (for up tp two sites) but it looks like shit.

Small Victories is free but it wants access to you entire Dropbox
