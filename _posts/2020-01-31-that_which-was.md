That, which was.[^1]
[^1]: Celan never uses the word ‘shoah’ , nor indeed ‘holocaust’: when referring to the past, he defines it ‘das, was war’, 

According to Agamben, also the choice of the word Shoah, ‘Catastrophe’, does not fully catch the essence, as it limits to a description; it is still an euphemism “as it implies the replacement of the proper expression of something which one does not really want to hear and talk about, with a diminished or altered expression, [and this is a process which] always brings ambiguities”. But in this case the ‘name’ does not contain any derision, any unpleasantness.
In 1945 people had to face an unprecedented fact, without a name, but a fact that did happen. A unique fact, as previously underlined. But Agamben asks to himself: But why it is unutterable? Why to give to extermination the privilege of mystics?

In order to develop his thought, Agamben goes back to a peculiar use of the Greek verb ‘euphemein’. According to the Father of the Church, the best way to glorify God is to respect his absolutely incomprehensible nature, his ‘unutterable, untellable, indescribable’ being. While some individuals are trying to understand the essence of God, the swarms of angels glorify him eternally: “(...) the latter [the angels] adore him in silence, the former [the men] keep themselves busy; the latter take their eyes off, the former are not ashamed to stare their look at the untellable glory”

Agamben continues as follows:

> The verb which we have translated as ‘to adore in silence’ is, in the Greek text, ‘euphemein’. From this word, that originally means ‘to observe religious silence’, comes the modern word ‘euphemism’; it indicates those terms replacing other terms which cannot be uttered due to shame or modesty. To say that Auschwitz is ‘unutterable’ or ‘incomprehensible’ is equal to ‘euphemein’, that is to adore it in silence, like you do with a God; it means, in spite of each one’s intention, to help to spread its glory. On the contrary, we “are not ashamed to stare our look at the untellable”. Even if we risk to find out what the evil knows about itself, we can easily find it also inside ourselves.
