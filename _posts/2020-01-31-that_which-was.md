# the time to come

i turn on the TV and there is isabelle hupert. many years ago i was in love with her.

in l'avenir she teaches philosophy and the film is replete with references to philosophy and psychoanalysis. the title is a reference to derrida's idea of two distinctly different kinds of futures, the predictable planned future of appointments and schedules and the future of inexplicable and unexpected events and encounters, the time to come.

her difficult and demanding mother dies and she inherits her mother's cat, pandora. she doesn't like the cat but carries it around with her everywhere in a cane basket. pandora is big and black and heavy.

the husband leaves her for a younger woman and when he moves out he takes all the emmanuel lévinas books with her notes in them, including 'a difficult freedom'.

she buys a new copy.

the cat brings her a mouse and she makes friends with him.

i am disappointed with the film. such a great premise. what a missed opportunity : the idea of the time to come affording a difficult freedom, and claiming it.

for lévinas ethics is centred on one's responsibility to the other. he is a humanist and so the other is always a human but if we take a posthumanist framing, the face of the other — which is what for lévinas inspires the individual to care and to think beyond themselves — could be the face of a river, or a rock, or a tree, or the night sky — the face of the ten to the power of five hundred universes and the eleven dimensions.

crucially, for lévinas, to care for the other takes place outside of an economy, there is no reward for or profit in caring for the other, either financially or in the afterlife. it is part of one's response-ability.

unfortunately in the end, it is that favourite trope of every humanist filmmaker who has run out of ideas, a baby, her first grandchild, that renews isabelle hupert's zest for life and ensures a sort of happy ending.

# That, which was.[^1]

> According to Agamben, also the choice of the word Shoah, ‘Catastrophe’, does not fully catch the essence, as it limits to a description; it is still an euphemism “as it implies the replacement of the proper expression of something which one does not really want to hear and talk about, with a diminished or altered expression, [and this is a process which] always brings ambiguities”. But in this case the ‘name’ does not contain any derision, any unpleasantness.
In 1945 people had to face an unprecedented fact, without a name, but a fact that did happen. A unique fact, as previously underlined. But Agamben asks to himself: But why it is unutterable? Why to give to extermination the privilege of mystics?

> In order to develop his thought, Agamben goes back to a peculiar use of the Greek verb ‘euphemein’. According to the Father of the Church, the best way to glorify God is to respect his absolutely incomprehensible nature, his ‘unutterable, untellable, indescribable’ being. While some individuals are trying to understand the essence of God, the swarms of angels glorify him eternally: “(...) the latter [the angels] adore him in silence, the former [the men] keep themselves busy; the latter take their eyes off, the former are not ashamed to stare their look at the untellable glory”

>Agamben continues as follows:

> The verb which we have translated as ‘to adore in silence’ is, in the Greek text, ‘euphemein’. From this word, that originally means ‘to observe religious silence’, comes the modern word ‘euphemism’; it indicates those terms replacing other terms which cannot be uttered due to shame or modesty. To say that Auschwitz is ‘unutterable’ or ‘incomprehensible’ is equal to ‘euphemein’, that is to adore it in silence, like you do with a God; it means, in spite of each one’s intention, to help to spread its glory. On the contrary, we “are not ashamed to stare our look at the untellable”. Even if we risk to find out what the evil knows about itself, we can easily find it also inside ourselves.
