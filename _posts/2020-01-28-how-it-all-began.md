as i begin to write what might, or might not, turn out to be the beginning of this book, it is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz. i am not sure if 'liberation' is the right word. most of the ones who were not killed or died from misery, illness, malnutrition or exhaustion (and you might well argue 'killed' is an appropriate word for them too) weren't there anymore but for the ones who were too sick to march, to bergen belsen and mauthausen and elsewhere, it _was_ liberation, as documented so unflinchingly by primo levi.

what is the measure of suffering? 

each and everyone's suffering is unique. you can never know someone's else suffering. it is difficult enough to know your own suffering, and most people are so occupied with their own suffering that there is very little room for anyone else's. this is the way of the world and of life. this is part of the human condition. 

if you are foolish enough to show anyone your suffering it is likely to make you suffer even more and most people know this, either innately or through bitter experience.

you become a patient, an inmate or a pariah.

this makes therapy and consolation problematic. i do not want to see or acknowledge your suffering because, even though it is more than likely very different, it reminds me of my own. it makes me feel my own suffering more acutely. at best i can try and persuade you that your suffering is in fact not as unbearable as you think and/or say it is, but i would be doing that more for myself than for you. 

but your suffering, if you were to reveal it to me, does somehow, mysteriously, make my own suffering less unbearable. 

working with people who are dying, and/or who are acutely aware of the real possibility that their death is imminent and people who are suffering unbearably and want to die, i learned that often all i could do is to acknowledge another's suffering, perhaps to connect with it, not by understanding it since that is impossible, but by bearing witness. 

so how to write a book of consolation? could a book be a witness? can i bear witness by writing a book? could someone be consoled by reading such a book? 




should i write about my own suffering then?
i cannot help but feel that my own suffering would need to be in the book, not in the hope that my suffering would be understood by someone reading about it, but in the hope that someone who is suffering would feel less alone. that they would be consoled somehow, mysteriously, making their own suffering less unbearable. 

a book is a conversation with the reader. i learned that by writing a book and it being published and read. i learned that from the readers of i am here who wrote to me or spoke to me about it. the process of writing and being read are inextricably entangled. publishing a book or publishing your writing in a different way, on the internet, or in a zine, creates the possibility of being read.

today the times published a picture that i haven't seen before. looking at this picture a journalist (...) wrote :

> ...

but mr.keane you are mistaken. czesława kwoka is not looking directly at the camera. she is deliberately, defiantly, *not* looking at it. even this, perhaps her last act of defiance, of her agency, is being taken away from her by such an interpretation. let us celebrate this ... her statement. i hear you czesława kwoka. i see you.

i had the realisation that my work with people who are suffering began long before i started working in a hospital. my compassion was awakened by portraits such as these and by the statement that poetry was impossible after auschwitz. i remember where i was when my friend told me this. he didn't know who said it, but he was surprised that i'd never heard it. it hit me like a bolt of lightening. i stood in the carpark of the art school in the hot sun and i didn't get into my car.

come on, my friend, who was in the car already, said. let's go!  
i got into the car.  
who was it? i asked.  
who was what?!  
he had already forgotten what he told me, which was something which would change my entire life, my work, my very being.  
that poetry is impossible after auschwitz.  
he didn't know.

that was before google but it wasn't hard to find out. they weren't his exact words but it was adorno — not that it matters. never was it clearer to me of how little importance the exact words and the identity of the original speaker of those words can be. what matters is how words can change a person. and ultimately this is why i am compelled to write. 

that's how it all began, and then there was primo levi, is this a man? and all the other testimonies and all the visual material i could find, and there was a lot.

i was still an artist then. i would never call my-so-called-self a poet and having visiting cards printed with my one of my pseudonyms, i.j.oog and 'dichter' (the dutch word for poet) was a strategy, what might be called, somewhat pretentiously, an intervention now, it was an artwork about the problem of being an artist, a kind of refusal. this would have been what, 1996 or 1997?

but i was still an artist and i wanted to make a memorial. a memorial that was somehow an artwork but that had a function, to acknowledge, to memorialise, a kind of kaddish, a eulogy, to bring them back to life a little bit, the ones that died. perhaps i felt like i could engage in a dialogue with them.

i put all the pictures i could find of people who were experimented on by joseph mengele in auschwitz into a database and i had a program select a random image from the database and put it on the screen. i also randomised the position, size and transparency of the image. and then i asked the program to put another image on top and so on until there were hundreds of images all with varying degrees of visibility on the screen. what was also interesting was that this particular version of the program (director) had glitch which sometimes randomly assigned colours that weren't 'meant' to be there.

the result was : memorial for the victims of medical experiments in auschwitz (dan zero, 1999). 'dan zero' was one of the pseudonyms used as an artist. i don't think i ever made any work under my so-called-real name.

here are some screenshots from it. i took hundreds of these and every one of them is unique because of the random nature of the programme and the glitch. but when i printed them i was not happy with the result. they were too still, and the luminosity was missing.

in 'on photography' susan sontag

Photography is to participate in another person’s (or other thing’s) mortality, vulnerability, mutability, Susan Sontag wrote in On Photography (1977) and that is where I began, without knowing it, perhaps even as she was writing that, with my father's Balda. He'd moved on to a Zenith and I moved on from photography and this is where I am now, in a room with four people, one of whom wants to die, and three others who want her, more than anything, to stay alive. 

For how long? It is a strange kind of bargaining. I can't go on, she repeats over and over again, not a day longer. But slowly as if magically, the three others find a way to break her resolve, but to call it resolve would be to overstate it. She doesn't want to die, she just doesn't want the life that she has. I mention the Dutch poet Rogi Wieg who said exactly that, before finally receiving medical euthanasia at the age of x. She livens up briefly. She knows his story, she has read his poems. His friend Joost Z. did everything he could to dissuade him. He rang and sent him messages. He arrived on his doorstep the night before the doctor was due to come and give him the end of life drugs.

A person who doesn't want to live but who is afraid to die. She exists somewhere in the zone between life and death. That is as vulnerable as it is possible for a human being to be. 

I haven't been looking forward to this conversation but I have said over and over that until I have a conversation with her and her family I cannot help her. And the law is such that if I provided her with a means to end her life I could well find my-so-called-self in front of a judge charged with assisting suicide. I am not unwilling to justify my decision to help someone die humanely but I would want to be able to say that I did so with the support of the people that loved and cared about the person.

It might be argued that I am a religious man even though I don't believe in God and I don't belong to any religion or subscribe to any creed, but I am radically optimistic about the mystery. (...)

There is something sacred about being, the Dutch writer Arnon Grunberg wrote (...)

I name the anger. her sister agrees that she is angry, her mother denies it. Her father says nothing but he looks angry. And exhausted. She is living in his house. He sleeps next to her to comfort her. He avoids my gaze. He didn't want to participate in this conversation but he agreed in the end, to appease her. she says she would hang herself in his house because she doesn't want to be found by him. I say, it doesn't matters who finds you. They will be traumatised by it in any case. 
 
They want her, if not to live, to remain alive because they believe in the possibility of change. They have to. Because they are seeing a person the love suffer. And they believe in the medical profession

My uncle Henk gave me an old Russian enlarger. Its main claim to fame was that the whole thing folded up in a suitcase. Every photograph I tried to print with that thing was fuzzy. None of them looked like the crisp sharp contrasty pictures I saw in magazines. But they didn't look like the grainy news photographs either. They just lacked definition altogether.

In a Freudian twist I became interested in photography because I admired my father's equipment and it seemed to be a way of making an image if you were hopeless at drawing as I was frequently told that I was. I only have a couple of drawing from before people started telling me that and I find them quite promising and I am moved by the innocence of the child who drew them. The colours are Paul Klee and the tree is clearly much more important to him than the house, but the feet on those people are big! And each foot is a different colour. And their mouths are big too, like the mouths of ... wait ... is that a clown? Were they critiquing the _realism_ of the pictures? Did they realise he was trying to draw _clowns_?

Photography allows you to participate in life and to not _do_ anything, other than to observe, record, document, aestheticise. And, if you're a scopophiliac it legitimises your activities.

When the state determined that people sitting on their arses watching television was not good for the economy in the 80s, it used public money to create a series of ads for Australian TV, "Life. Be in it", encouraging people to 'do things'. But what about those people who for numerous and interesting reasons don't want to be 'in it'?

In Auschwitz, Primo Levi noticed a group muselmen 

My conversations with holocaust survivors, and with cancer sufferers, in my conversations with people who are suffering in such a way that they want to end their lives, or that they can't go on  

what is it that makes it possible for some people to 'carry on'?
