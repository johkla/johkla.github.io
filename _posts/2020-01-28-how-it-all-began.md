as i begin to write what might, or might not, turn out to be the beginning of this book, it is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz. i am not sure that liberation is the right word. most of the ones who were not killed or died from misery, illness, malnutrition or exhaustion and you might well argue 'killed' is an appropriate word for them too, weren't there anymore but ok for the ones who were too sick to march, to bergen belsen and mauthausen and elsewhere, it was liberation, as documented so unflinchingly by primo levi.

what is the measure of suffering? 

each and everyone's suffering is unique. you can never know someone's else suffering. it is difficult enough to know your own suffering, and most people are so occupied with their own suffering that there is very little room for anyone else's. this is the way of the world and of life. this is part of the human condition. 

if you are foolish enough to show anyone your suffering it is likely to make you suffer even more and most people know this, either innately or through bitter experience.

you become a patient, an inmate or a pariah.

this makes therapy and consolation problematic. i do not want to see or acknowledge your suffering because, even though it is more than likely very different, it reminds me of my own. it makes me feel my own suffering more acutely. at best i can try and persuade you that your suffering is in fact not as unbearable as you think and/or say it is, but i would be doing that more for myself than for you. 

your suffering, if you were to reveal it to me i [.] 

working with people who are dying, and/or who are acutely aware of the real possibility that their death is imminent and people who are suffering unbearably and want to die, i learned that often all i could do is to acknowledge another's suffering, perhaps to connect with it, not by understanding it since that is impossible, but by bearing witness. 

so how to write a book of consolation? could a book be a witness? can i bear witness by writing a book? could someone be consoled by reading such a book? 
that 


should i write about my own suffering then?
i cannot help but feel that my own suffering would need to be in the book, not in the hope that my suffering would be understood by someone reading about it, but in the hope that someone who is suffering would feel less alone.

a book is a conversation with the reader. i learned that by writing a book and it being published and read. i learned that from the readers of i am here who wrote to me or spoke to me about it. the process of writing and being read are inextricably entangled. publishing a book or publishing your writing in a different way, on the internet, or in a zine, creates the possibility of being read.

today the times published a picture that i haven't seen before.

> mr.keane you are mistaken. czesława kwoka is not looking directly at the camera. she is deliberately, defiantly, *not* looking at it. even this, perhaps it was her last act of defiance, of agency, is being taken away from her by your interpretation. let us celebrate this ... her statement. i hear you czesława kwoka. i see you.

i had the realisation that my work with people who are suffering began long before i started working in a hospital. my compassion was awakened by portraits such as these and by the statement that poetry was impossible after auschwitz. i remember where i was when my friend told me this. he didn't know who said it, but he was surprised that i'd never heard it. it hit me like a bolt of lightening. i stood in the carpark of the art school in the hot sun and i didn't get into my car.

come on, my friend, who was in the car already, said. let's go!  
i got into the car.  
who was it? i asked.  
who was what?!  
he had already forgotten what he told me, which was something which would change my entire life, my work, my very being.  
that poetry is impossible after auschwitz.  
he didn't know.

that was before google but it wasn't hard to find out. they weren't his exact words but it was adorno — not that it matters. never was it clearer to me of how little importance the exact words and the identity of the original speaker of those words can be. what matters is how words can change a person. and ultimately this is why i am compelled to write. 

that's how it all began, and then there was primo levi, is this a man? and all the other testimonies and all the visual material i could find, and there was a lot.

i was still an artist then. i would never call my-so-called-self a poet and having visiting cards printed with my one of my pseudonyms, i.j.oog and 'dichter' (the dutch word for poet) was a strategy, what might be called, somewhat pretentiously, an intervention now, it was an artwork about the problem of being an artist, a kind of refusal. this would have been what, 1996 or 1997?

but i was still an artist and i wanted to make a memorial. a memorial that was somehow an artwork but that had a function, to acknowledge, to memorialise, a kind of kaddish, a eulogy, to bring them back to life a little bit, the ones that died. perhaps i felt like i could engage in a dialogue with them.

i put all the pictures i could find of people who were experimented on by joseph mengele in auschwitz into a database and i had a program select a random image from the database and put it on the screen. i also randomised the position, size and transparency of the image. and then i asked the program to put another image on top and so on until there were hundreds of images all with varying degrees of visibility on the screen. what was also interesting was that this particular version of the program (director) had glitch which sometimes randomly assigned colours that weren't 'meant' to be there.

the result was : memorial for the victims of medical experiments in auschwitz (dan zero, 1999). 'dan zero' was one of the pseudonyms used as an artist. i don't think i ever made any work under my so-called-real name.

here are some screenshots from it. i took hundreds of these and every one of them is unique because of the random nature of the programme and the glitch.
