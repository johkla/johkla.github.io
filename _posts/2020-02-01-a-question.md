you have compassion for other people, beings, and things. for the world. you love and you are loved and you will be loved. 

each tree, river, lake, mountain, stone, each grain of sand is asking you a question. perhaps it is not even a question, maybe it is more of an invitation :

... exist beyond the self ... beyond _your_ self ... it's not even yours ... 

please donâ€™t say no.   
please don't say no to the world.

if you love yourself too much it is a big problem.  
if you don't love yourself enough it is also a big problem.  
but if you loved yourself before and now you don't love yourself that is the biggest problem of all.

perhaps it's a command.  
it may even be a demand...?
