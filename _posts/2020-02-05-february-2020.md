# spiritual

in the torturous application process for final approval to commence work as a supervisor in the spiritual care department of the largest oncological hospital in the southern hemisphere, the question arises, 'what is my spiritual community?'. since i don't belong to any religion this is interesting in a range of different theological and philosophical ways. to begin let's consider what 'spiritual' could mean in a secular context. 

'spiritual' is one of those words which means many different things to different people and one might say that the word has been corrupted in such a way as to make its usefulness moot; but if one is training as a spiritual carer or supervising such training, obviously it cannot be avoided. 

in considering its etymology, the root of the word 'spirit' is 'spire' which means 'breath'. this is echoed in words like 'inspire', 'aspire' and 'expire' — and the idea of inspiration. when you ask someone 'what is your spirituality', are you asking 'what inspires you?'. what makes you feel alive? what makes you feel/think/believe that despite your own suffering and pain, and all the suffering, cruelty and injustice in the world, it is possible to continue, to live and to work, and to connect with others? and what do you aspire to? what would you like to be able to do before _you_ expire? 

these are questions a spiritual carer _cares_ about — and questions a spiritual carer might, under the right circumstances, put to someone that they're working with. they might also be questions that a supervisor asks of someone who is training as a spiritual carer.

when it comes to the questions : *what is a community?* and *what does it mean 'to care'?* we might also ask if the two questions are connected. does community mean : people (and, if you are a posthumanist, also other living and non-living beings and entities) that are connected and that care? what do they care _about_ and/or for whom?

in [this news story](https://nos.nl/artikel/2321402-buurt-utrecht-neemt-afscheid-van-geliefde-170-jaar-oude-beuk.html) (in dutch) what connects people, what makes them a community, is that they care about this 170 year old tree.

as to what spiritual health is or could be, i think codswallop is what that is. this word is a good word with a very specific meaning although there is some debate about which meaning is 'the one'. one : a long time ago cod the fish was so plentiful in the seas around northern europe that it was considered to have very little value and so 'cod' was used in that way. 

# a question

you have compassion for other people, beings, and things. for the world. you love and you are loved and you will be loved. 

each tree, river, lake, mountain, stone, each grain of sand is asking you a question. perhaps it is not even a question, maybe it is more of an invitation :

... exist beyond the self ... beyond _your_ self ... it's not even yours ... 

please don’t say no.   
please don't say no to the world.

if you love yourself too much it is a big problem.  
if you don't love yourself enough it is also a big problem.  
but if you loved yourself before and now you don't love yourself that is the biggest problem of all.

perhaps it's a command.  
it may even be a demand...?  

# sacred

did i post this before?

> Er zit in het bestaan iets heiligs. Het onbegrijpelijke. Wat zich onttrekt aan de rede, wat zich onttrekt aan de ratio. Ik denk dat iedereen het bestaan weleens als iets overweldigends heeft ervaren, zowel in positieve als in negatieve zin.

— Arnon Grunberg   
Trouw interview Stevo Akkerman 31-5-2019

In being there is something sacred. The incomprehensible. That which hides itself from reason, that which hides itself from rationality. I think that everyone at one time or another has experienced being as something overwhelming, in both a positive and a negative sense.
