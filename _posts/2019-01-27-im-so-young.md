title : i'm so young ... i’m so goddamned young
---

i wrote a long response to your txt about being young, but i didn’t send it yet. i can’t get it right. but i am determined not to write another thousand words addressed to you and then not to send them, i told you about that email months ago, so i will return to it tomorrow.

it is curious isn’t it : you are young and i am old. i am almost old enough to be your grandfather, not quite but i may well be older than your father. the woman i was with 25 years ago became pregnant and had an abortion. i was more keen on the abortion than she was. you could be that child. 

but i don’t care about any of that.

i'm so young ... i’m so goddamned young, patti smith sings at the very end of gloria on her first record, horses. she was in utrecht the other day but i didn’t know it and i don’t care even though 40 years ago i was in love with her, as much as you can ever be with someone you don’t know, but then of course i thought/felt/believed that i did know her, or i knew what she allowed me to know of her. i thought/felt/believed she transmitted something of crucial importance to me when i was 19. that i could be free and that i had a kind of duty to be free. an obligation to life itself and she was a real live connection with a tradition from rimbaud and wilhelm reich to jimi hendrix
