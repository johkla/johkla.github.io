# truth

in russian there are two different words for truth — i let a talking head on tv tell me this.* one of the words, Правда (pravda), is apparently a 'more aspirational truth' and therefore the word can be utilised for purposes that are not in fact related to saying something about how things actually are. now i recognise that speaking in terms of 'how things actually are' is deeply problematic, both philosophically, politically and from the point of view of psychoanalysis ... i mean posthumanist therapy. 

the other day i was having an asynchronous conversation with someone about what would be the first lesson of psychoanalysis ... i mean posthumanist therapy. the heading would be 'lesson one : what is truth?'. i started writing it but, like most things i am doing, it is nowhere near finished.

and in english?

i am not in favour of the misuse of the prefix post— which in the case of 'post-truth' seems to have lead to the idea that truth has become irrelevant and thus straight-faced lying, and just saying that you didn't do what you obviously did do or that what happened did not, is perfectly acceptable, especially if you're a politician or a news organisation which is owned by, and whose function is to represent the facts in a way which suits, the powers that be and the rich.  

but there is 'sooth' as in 'soothsayer' — now archaic but maybe it could be revived. is that the truth, we used to say, or did you read it in the daily mail? (a notorious right wing uk newspaper.) i still say it with some regularity when the old man i live with expounds, at excruciating length, some absurd conspiracy theory and/or a horrendous wilful misreading of historical events. (am i using wilful appropriately there? wilful and deliberate are not the same thing! i think i learned this from sarah ahmed and i am not just saying that to parade my woke credentials)

'sooth' could be an appropriate word for a kind of soothing truth, like saying 'it's ok' when it's not actually, but the intention is to try and make it so, to console or to make someone feel better — and a soothsayer : one who by speaking, soothes, who speaks sooth, a different kind of aspirational truth perhaps?

<small>*this is a straight translation of something dutch speakers say which i rather like in the context of so called post-truth : 'ik heb me laten vertellen dat...' it means that you 'allowed' someone tell to you something. it is a kind of humble pre-amble to something else you're about to say that you don't necessarily endorse yourself and/or that you cannot vouch for its veracity.</small>

# spiritual

in the torturous application process for final approval to commence work as a supervisor in the spiritual care department of the largest oncological hospital in the southern hemisphere, the question arises, 'what is my spiritual community?'. since i don't belong to any religion this is interesting in a range of different theological and philosophical ways. to begin let's consider what 'spiritual' could mean in a secular context. 

'spiritual' is one of those words which means many different things to different people and one might say that the word has been corrupted in such a way as to make its usefulness moot; but if one is training as a spiritual carer or supervising such training, obviously it cannot be avoided. 

in considering its etymology, the root of the word 'spirit' is 'spire' which means 'breath'. this is echoed in words like 'inspire', 'aspire' and 'expire' — and the idea of inspiration. when you ask someone 'what is your spirituality', are you asking 'what inspires you?'. what makes you feel alive? what makes you feel/think/believe that despite your own suffering and pain, and all the suffering, cruelty and injustice in the world, it is possible to continue, to live and to work, and to connect with others? and what do you aspire to? what would you like to be able to do before _you_ expire? 

these are questions a spiritual carer _cares_ about — and questions a spiritual carer might, under the right circumstances, put to someone that they're working with. they might also be questions that a supervisor asks of someone who is training as a spiritual carer.

when it comes to the questions : *what is a community?* and *what does it mean 'to care'?* we might also ask if the two questions are connected. does community mean : people (and, if you are a posthumanist, also other living and non-living beings and entities) that are connected and that care? what do they care _about_ and/or for whom?

in [this news story](https://nos.nl/artikel/2321402-buurt-utrecht-neemt-afscheid-van-geliefde-170-jaar-oude-beuk.html) (in dutch) what connects people, what makes them a community, is that they care about this 170 year old tree.

as to what spiritual health is or could be, i think codswallop is what that is. this word is a good word with a very specific meaning although there is some debate about which meaning is 'the one'. one : a long time ago cod the fish was so plentiful in the seas around northern europe that it was considered to have very little value and so 'cod' was used in that way. 

# a question

you have compassion for other people, beings, and things. for the world. you love and you are loved and you will be loved. 

each tree, river, lake, mountain, stone, each grain of sand is asking you a question. perhaps it is not even a question, maybe it is more of an invitation :

... exist beyond the self ... beyond _your_ self ... it's not even yours ... 

please don’t say no.   
please don't say no to the world.

if you love yourself too much it is a big problem.  
if you don't love yourself enough it is also a big problem.  
but if you loved yourself before and now you don't love yourself that is the biggest problem of all.

perhaps it's a command.  
it may even be a demand...?  

# sacred

did i post this before?

> Er zit in het bestaan iets heiligs. Het onbegrijpelijke. Wat zich onttrekt aan de rede, wat zich onttrekt aan de ratio. Ik denk dat iedereen het bestaan weleens als iets overweldigends heeft ervaren, zowel in positieve als in negatieve zin.

— Arnon Grunberg   
Trouw interview Stevo Akkerman 31-5-2019

In being there is something sacred. The incomprehensible. That which hides itself from reason, that which hides itself from rationality. I think that everyone at one time or another has experienced being as something overwhelming, in both a positive and a negative sense.

(apologies for the poor translation)
