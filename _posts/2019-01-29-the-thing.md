what really gave me the shits about religion when i was young was not god or the idea that there were things i couldn't see or feel or understand that were hugely important — that seemed obvious and i *wanted* to know about those things — it was that the people who claimed to know about those things (and about one Thing in particular) had very definite opinions about what i should do and not do, and they claimed that those opinions came *from* the Thing.

now, fifty years later, i can laugh heartily at those people, because i know, or at least i think/feel/believe, that the whole point is to work out for yourself what to do and not do.

it took a long time to that work out and it would have been great if i'd known that from the beginning, if someone had told me that. but then they're not going to tell you that are they, because they want you to do what you're told.
