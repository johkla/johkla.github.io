as well as slowly, slowly failing at a range of things (postlove, being a therapist, writing a second book, crafting a brand new handmade lo-tech website) i've totally given up on social media due to its extreme stupidity but of course i have a different relation to my own stupidity so i can't help but want to post links to interesting bits and pieces and to comment on things i see and read, even if it's only to say "jeez" or "omfg!!!!!!". 

but i'd rather do so in a place to which people have to go specifically if they are interested rather than being part of a commercial stream of digital detritus alongside ads for things an algorithm has determined you should need or want. 

so ... enter pinboard, 'a social bookmarking site for introverts', made by the inimitable maciej ceg≈Çowski (who also [coined the idea of slowly, slowly falling](https://www.wired.com/2013/11/the-next-big-thing-you-missed/)) which i've been using for my own bookmarks since 2007.

below are my 12 most recent public pinboard posts and [all of my public posts and comments are here](https://pinboard.in/u:posthumanist)

on [pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:posthumanist) you can see my posts on specific tags/topics by clicking on a tag/topic on the right hand side of screen eg [here are all my mac links](https://pinboard.in/u:posthumanist/t:mac/). each tag/topic also has its own rss feed for those that are that way inclined.
